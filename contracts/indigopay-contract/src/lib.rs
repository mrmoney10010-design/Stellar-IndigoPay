 *
 * Stellar IndigoPay — Climate Donation Tracking Contract
 *
 * This contract provides on-chain transparency for every donation:
 *
 *   1. Admin registers verified climate projects on-chain
 *   2. Donors call donate() — XLM sent directly to project wallet
 *   3. Contract records every donation immutably
 *   4. Anyone can query total raised, donor count, CO2 offset per project
 *   5. Impact badges auto-calculated based on cumulative donor totals
 *   6. Community governance: badge holders vote to verify new projects
 *
 * Build:
 *   cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release
 *
 * Deploy:
 *   stellar contract deploy \
 *     --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/indigopay_contract.wasm \
 *     --source alice --network testnet

// ─── Off-Chain Oracle Attestation for Project Impact Verification (#459) ────
//
// Independent verifiers submit signed attestations of a project's actual
// CO2 impact. This keeps `co2_per_xlm` honest without trusting either the
// project or the platform alone:
//
//   1. Admin authorises verifier addresses via `add_impact_verifier`.
//   2. A verifier calls `submit_impact_report` with the rate they measured
//      off-chain and a hash of their supporting evidence. Resubmission by
//      the same verifier for the same project updates their existing report
//      in place rather than creating a second one.
//   3. Every submission is checked against the project's current
//      `co2_per_xlm` ("claimed rate"); a >=50% deviation sets a sticky
//      `ImpactFlagged` marker for the project (cleared explicitly by an
//      admin via `clear_impact_flag`).
//   4. Once a configurable number of distinct verifiers have reported,
//      `co2_per_xlm` is auto-adjusted to the median of their verified
//      rates. The adjustment re-runs on every later submission so the rate
//      stays current as reports are added or updated.
//
// Kept as a separate `ImpactVerificationKey` enum (mirroring `ImpactKey`
// above) rather than new `DataKey` variants so this feature can be toggled
// without touching the encoding of the shared, always-on `DataKey` enum.

// ─── Off-Chain Multi-Verifier Project Verification Oracle ──────────────────
//
// A configurable M-of-N committee of admin-appointed verifiers attests that
// a registered project has passed independent off-chain due diligence (the
// contract does not interpret what "verified" means — only that enough
// distinct, authorised verifiers vouched for it via a hash of their
// evidence). Deliberately separate from `impact_verification` above: that
// feature audits an *ongoing metric* (co2_per_xlm); this one gates a
// project's *eligibility to receive donations at all*.
//
//   1. Admins authorise verifier addresses via `add_verifier` (M-of-N).
//   2. A verifier calls `attest_project` once per project with a hash of
//      their evidence. A second call from the same verifier for the same
//      project panics rather than silently updating — resubmission is not
//      supported (unlike `impact_verification`'s reports), so a verifier
//      who made a mistake needs an admin to `revoke_verification` first.
//   3. Once `VerificationThreshold` distinct verifiers have attested, the
//      project auto-transitions to `Verified` in the same call that
//      crosses the threshold.
//   4. Every `donate*` entry point rejects donations to a project that is
//      not `Verified`, unless `VerificationThreshold == 0` (legacy/
//      disabled mode) and the project is still `Unverified` — this keeps
//      every project registered before this feature existed donatable.
//   5. Admins may `revoke_verification` (M-of-N) at any time, clearing all
//      accumulated attestations and returning the project to `Unverified`.
//
// Kept as a separate `ProjectVerificationKey` enum — mirroring
// `ImpactVerificationKey` above — rather than new `DataKey` variants.
// Appending `#[cfg(feature = "project_verification")]`-gated variants
// directly to the shared, always-on `DataKey` enum would shift every
// later variant's XDR discriminant depending on whether the feature is
// compiled in, silently corrupting storage reads across builds with
// different feature sets. A separate enum sidesteps that hazard entirely.
