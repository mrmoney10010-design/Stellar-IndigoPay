# Security Audit

This document records the security review of the IndigoPay contract.

## Phase A — Trust model hardening (two-step admin, contract pause, 48h upgrade timelock)

> **Note**: Phase A introduced two-step admin transfer with single-admin keys. Phase B (below) supersedes the admin model with multi-sig threshold signatures. The two-step transfer is preserved but redesigned as an in-place swap within the admin set. The contract pause and upgrade timelock remain unchanged.

The previous design had three single-admin SPOFs:

1. **Admin transfer was instant** — a single compromised signature could silently give the attacker full control.
2. **No contract-level pause** — only per-project pause existed, leaving no way to halt the contract during an incident.
3. **Upgrade was instant** — `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)` swapped the WASM in one transaction, with no community review window.

Phase A replaces all three with a stronger trust model.

### 1. Two-step admin transfer

The admin key is now a two-step handoff:

1. **Step 1** — current admin calls `transfer_admin(admin, new_admin)`. The proposed admin is stored under `DataKey::PendingAdmin` and an `ad_xfer` event is emitted.
2. **Step 2** — the proposed admin calls `accept_admin()`. The contract reads the pending entry and promotes it. Auth is gated by `pending.require_auth()`, so only the proposed recipient (not the old admin) can promote themselves.
3. **Cancel** — the current admin may call `cancel_admin_transfer(admin)` to clear the pending entry if the proposed recipient lost their key or the transfer was a mistake.

State invariants:

- `accept_admin` panics with `"No pending admin transfer"` if no proposal exists.
- `transfer_admin` panics with `"Admin transfer already pending; cancel first"` if a proposal is already in flight, preventing an attacker from overwriting a pending recipient.
- `accept_admin` does not take a caller argument — the only value the contract trusts to become admin is the stored pending entry. There is no path for an imposter to promote a different address.

### 2. Contract-level pause

A single boolean `DataKey::ContractPaused` (default `false`) gates every state-mutating public function:

- `donate`, `donate_usdc`
- `mint_impact_nft`, `mint_project_nft`
- `create_proposal`, `vote_verify_project`
- `register_project`, `batch_register_projects`
- `update_project_co2_rate`, `deactivate_project`, `deactivate_all_projects`
- `set_usdc_token`, `set_oracle`

Read-only getters continue to work while the contract is paused, so off-chain UIs and indexers can keep polling.

The pause functions (`pause_contract` / `unpause_contract`), the admin-recovery functions (`transfer_admin` / `accept_admin` / `cancel_admin_transfer`), and the upgrade lifecycle (`propose_upgrade` / `execute_upgrade` / `cancel_upgrade`) are **deliberately not pause-gated** so the admin can always recover from a paused contract or cancel a pending upgrade during an incident.

The `require_not_paused` helper is called immediately after `require_auth` and before any storage read, so a paused-contract call panics as cheaply as possible.

### 3. 48-hour upgrade timelock

The old single-step `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)` is removed in favour of a 48-hour timelock:

1. **Step 1** — admin calls `propose_upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)`. The hash is stored under `DataKey::PendingUpgrade`; the earliest executable ledger is stored under `DataKey::UpgradeEffectiveAt`. An `upg_prop` event is emitted with both values.
2. **Wait 48h** — `UPGRADE_TIMELOCK_LEDGERS = 34_560` ledgers (48h × 3600s / 5s/ledger) must elapse.
3. **Step 2** — anyone may call `execute_upgrade()` after the timelock has elapsed. On success the contract WASM is swapped via `env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm`, the executed hash is recorded under `DataKey::LastExecutedUpgrade`, and an `upg_exec` event is emitted.
4. **Cancel** — admin may call `cancel_upgrade(admin)` at any time before execution to drop a pending upgrade.

**SECURITY**: the 48h timelock is the SOLE delay between a proposed upgrade and its execution. If the admin key is compromised, the attacker can `propose_upgrade` immediately, but the community has 48h to react (exit positions, deploy a rescue contract, signal objections off-chain) before the WASM is swapped. There is no second gate.

Helpers:

- `get_pending_upgrade() -> Option<(BytesN<32>, u32)>` — hash + effective_at ledger of the pending upgrade, or `None`.
- `get_last_executed_upgrade() -> Option<BytesN<32>>` — hash of the most-recently executed upgrade. `None` if the contract has never been upgraded.

## Phase B — Multi-sig admin with threshold signatures

Phase B replaces the single-admin model (`DataKey::Admin`) with a multi-signature admin system supporting M-of-N threshold signatures.

### Problem addressed

A single compromised admin key could: deactivate all projects, pause the contract indefinitely, propose a malicious upgrade (with 48h delay), change the USDC token address, or change the oracle address. Multi-sig raises the bar from "compromise one key" to "compromise M of N keys simultaneously."

### New data model

| Key                 | Type             | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `DataKey::AdminSet` | `Vec<Address>`   | Set of authorized admin addresses               |
| `DataKey::AdminThreshold` | `u32`     | Number of valid admin signatures required for critical operations |

The former `DataKey::Admin` variant is removed.

### Admin action tiers

**Critical actions** (require M-of-N signatures):
- `propose_upgrade`, `cancel_upgrade`
- `pause_contract`, `unpause_contract`
- `transfer_admin`, `cancel_admin_transfer`
- `deactivate_all_projects`
- `create_proposal`, `veto_proposal`
- `add_admin`, `remove_admin`, `update_threshold`

**Routine actions** (require 1-of-N signature):
- `register_project`, `batch_register_projects`
- `deactivate_project`, `pause_project`, `resume_project`
- `update_project_co2_rate`
- `set_usdc_token`, `set_oracle`, `set_donation_rate_limit`

### Multi-sig verification (`verify_m_of_n`)

The core verification function iterates the supplied `signers` vec:

1. Calls `signer.require_auth()` on each address (Soroban host-level cryptographic verification)
2. Checks membership in the admin set
3. **Deduplicates**: a `counted` vec ensures each address is counted only once, preventing a single compromised key from satisfying the threshold by passing itself multiple times
4. Panics with `"Insufficient admin signatures: M/N required"` if valid count < threshold

### Admin set management

All admin set mutations require M-of-N signatures:

- **`add_admin(signers, new_admin)`** — adds a new address. Panics if already an admin.
- **`remove_admin(signers, admin_to_remove)`** — removes an address. Panics if it would leave the set empty, or if the resulting set is smaller than the current threshold (forces explicit `update_threshold` first).
- **`update_threshold(signers, new_threshold)`** — updates the threshold. Must satisfy `1 <= threshold <= admin_set.len()`.

### Two-step admin transfer (in-place swap)

The two-step transfer is redesigned as an in-place swap that preserves the admin set size and threshold:

1. **Step 1** — M-of-N admins call `transfer_admin(signers, old_admin, new_admin)`. Validates that `old_admin` is in the set and `new_admin` is not. Stores `(old_admin, new_admin)` tuple under `DataKey::PendingAdmin`.
2. **Step 2** — `new_admin` calls `accept_admin()`. Performs a staleness check on both `old_admin` (must still be in set) and `new_admin` (must not have been independently added). Swaps `old_admin` for `new_admin` in-place within the admin set.
3. **Cancel** — M-of-N admins call `cancel_admin_transfer(signers)` to clear the pending entry.

**Security properties**:
- The admin set size N and threshold are never modified by a transfer
- The M-of-N group authorizes "swap A for B", not "dissolve everything"
- Staleness guards prevent both `old_admin` removal and `new_admin` independent addition from corrupting the set
- `new_admin` must self-authenticate via `accept_admin` (proves key control)

### Initialization

```rust
pub fn initialize(env: Env, admins: Vec<Address>, threshold: u32)
```

Validates: `admins` is non-empty, `threshold >= 1`, `threshold <= admins.len()`.

**Backward compatibility**: when threshold=1 and the admin set contains one address, behavior is identical to the previous single-admin model.

### Event audit trail

Every state change in the trust model emits an indexed event for indexer consumers:

| Event topic  | Trigger                                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `ad_xfer`    | `transfer_admin` queued (old_admin → new_admin) |
| `ad_acc`     | `accept_admin` swap completed                  |
| `ad_xfc`     | `cancel_admin_transfer` cleared                |
| `paused`     | `pause_contract` set the pause flag            |
| `unpause`    | `unpause_contract` lifted the pause flag       |
| `upg_prop`   | `propose_upgrade` queued (hash + effective_at) |
| `upg_exec`   | `execute_upgrade` swapped the WASM             |
| `upg_cncl`   | `cancel_upgrade` dropped the pending upgrade   |
| `admin_add`  | `add_admin` added a new admin to the set       |
| `admin_rmv`  | `remove_admin` removed an admin from the set   |
| `thresh_up`  | `update_threshold` changed the threshold       |

## Integer overflow prevention

This section records the security review of arithmetic operations in the IndigoPay contract, with focus on integer overflow in global stats accumulators.

### Scope

Audit covers all arithmetic in `record_donation` and related functions that update global state:

- `GlobalTotalRaised` (i128)
- `GlobalCO2OffsetGrams` (i128)
- Project and donor statistics

### Findings

#### Protected Operations

All critical arithmetic operations use Rust's checked_add to prevent silent overflow:

1. **GlobalTotalRaised updates**
   - Line 311: `gr.checked_add(amount).expect("GlobalTotalRaised overflow")`
   - Line 610: `gr.checked_add(xlm_equivalent).expect(...)`
   - Panics if sum exceeds i128::MAX (9,223,372,036,854,775,807)

2. **GlobalCO2OffsetGrams updates**
   - Line 315: `gc.checked_add(co2_increment).expect("GlobalCO2 overflow")`
   - Line 614: `gg.checked_add(co2_increment).expect(...)`
   - Panics if sum exceeds i128::MAX

3. **Pre-computation of CO2 increment**
   - Line 260: `xlm_units.checked_mul(project.co2_per_xlm as i128).expect("CO2 calculation overflow")`
   - Prevents multiplication overflow before accumulation

4. **Project and Donor statistics**
   - Line 273: Project total_raised uses checked_add
   - Line 283: Donor total_donated uses checked_add
   - Line 287: Donor co2_offset_grams uses checked_add
   - All checked operations with panic on overflow

### Extreme Input Analysis

Max donation scenarios:

- Single donation: i128::MAX stroops (9.22e18 XLM equivalent)
- With CO2 factor: 100 grams/XLM max project setting
  - Overflow would occur at: i128::MAX / 100 = 9.22e16 XLM
  - Current check prevents all overflow paths

- Multiple donations accumulating to GlobalTotalRaised:
  - Each donation checked individually before accumulation
  - Cumulative cap: i128::MAX (9.22e18 stroops total)
  - Current design prevents integer wrap-around

### Conclusion

No silent overflows possible. All operations that could exceed i128::MAX will panic with descriptive messages. The contract is safe for production use with any realistic donation volume.

## Donation Refund (#290)

### Trust model

`approve_refund` requires **both** admin authorization (`require_admin_for_routine`) **and** `project.wallet.require_auth()`. This means the token transfer from project wallet → donor happens atomically inside `approve_refund` (CEI ordering — all counter decrements are written before the transfer fires). If the project wallet does not co-sign, the normal approval reverts entirely.

This provides on-chain enforcement that "Approved = Paid" for three of the four motivating scenarios:
- Donor sent to the wrong project
- Donor entered the wrong amount
- Technical error in the transaction

For the fourth scenario (a fraudulent or adversarial project wallet),
`force_approve_refund` provides a separate safety valve:

1. The configured M-of-N admin threshold must authorize initiation.
2. `DataKey::ForceRefund(refund_id)` records a 72-hour (51,840-ledger)
   timelock. The refund remains `Pending`, and no accounting changes or token
   transfers occur at initiation.
3. Any single current admin may cancel during the review window. Once the
   effective ledger is reached, cancellation is disabled and anyone may call
   `execute_force_refund`.
4. Execution pays the donor from the canonical
   `ProjectContractBalance(project_id, token)` contract-held pool, marks the
   request `Approved`, and applies the same amount and CO₂ reversals as the
   normal path.

The force path does **not** seize tokens from the project wallet and does not
assume that a Soroban token allowance will remain available. Operators must
pre-fund the relevant project/token contract balance; execution reverts
atomically with `Insufficient force refund pool balance` if it is insufficient.
The pool is checked by both project ID and token address, so one project's
force-refund cannot consume accounting attributed to another project. Contract
token balances not represented by this canonical ledger are never used.

This changes the trust model: M-of-N admins can schedule use of contract-held
funds for a full refund, while a 72-hour public review window and single-admin
cancellation limit colluding or compromised-admin abuse. A force escalation
must be cancelled before the request can return to the normal approve/reject
flow, preventing stale escalation records.

### Pre-upgrade CO₂ limitation

CO₂ offset values for donations are snapshotted in `DataKey::DonationCO2Offset(u32)` at donation time. Pre-upgrade donations lack this key, so refunds for those donations use `co2_offset_grams = 0` — meaning `GlobalCO2OffsetGrams` is not reversed for pre-upgrade refunds. This creates a small, bounded, one-directional drift: the global counter may be marginally overstated relative to true refunded volume. This is an accepted, documented limitation.

### Badge permanence

Badge tiers and minted NFTs are **never** downgraded or burned on refund. The refund adjusts `total_donated` and `co2_offset_grams` but does not call `calculate_badge()`. A donor who reaches EarthGuardian and later refunds all donations keeps their EarthGuardian badge and any minted ImpactNFTs. This is a deliberate design choice — badges are permanent artifacts, not live counters.

### Underflow protection

All counter decrements on refund use `checked_sub(...).expect("...underflow on refund")`, consistent with the `checked_add` convention used for donations. If a refund would drive any counter negative, the transaction panics and reverts.

## Stealth Address Donation Integration (#458)

### Privacy model

`donate_stealth_integrated` integrates the standalone stealth address infrastructure (`DonationContract`) into `IndigoPayContract` while preserving donor privacy guarantees:

1. **Unlinkable stealth addresses**: Stealth address generation uses diffie-hellman ephemeral keys (`generate_stealth_address`), ensuring on-chain indexers cannot correlate stealth donations to a single donor wallet address.
2. **Donor stats decoupling**: `donate_stealth_integrated` updates project `total_raised`, `GlobalTotalRaised`, and `GlobalCO2OffsetGrams`, but explicitly **bypasses** `DonorStats`, `DonorProjectTotal`, `HasDonated`, and `project.donor_count` updates. No cumulative donor record or badge progress is assigned to the sender address.
3. **Zero-address record indexing**: The `DonationRecord` on `IndigoPayContract` records `donor` as a dedicated zero-address (`0x00...00`), and emits `stlth_don` event topic with the zero-address as donor.
4. **Cross-contract authorization**: The `sender.require_auth()` authorization gates the invocation at the `IndigoPayContract` boundary and propagates to `DonationContract.donate_stealth` for atomic token transfer from sender to stealth escrow contract.

### Custody model and withdrawal path (#621)

Stealth-donated tokens are held by the `DonationContract` (the stealth escrow
contract) until the project wallet withdraws them — they are **never** held by
`IndigoPayContract` and are **not** part of `ProjectContractBalance`.

- **Per-(project_wallet, token) accounting**: `donate_stealth` credits the
  project's withdrawable balance in the `DonationContract` for every successful
  donation, so no stealth donation is ever stranded.
- **Project-wallet-gated withdrawal**: `withdraw_stealth_donations` moves the
  balance to the project wallet itself. Only the `project_wallet` address can
  withdraw; neither the main-contract admin nor any third party can drain a
  project's stealth funds. The main contract exposes
  `withdraw_stealth_integrated(project_id, token, amount)` which resolves the
  project's wallet, requires its root-level auth, and forwards the call.
- **CEI ordering**: the withdrawable balance is decremented *before* the
  external token transfer, so a reentrant/malicious token cannot double-drain.
  Structured errors (`DonationError`) reject zero-amount and over-balance
  withdrawals.
- **Reconciliation**: both `withdraw_stealth_donations` and
  `withdraw_stealth_integrated` emit withdrawal events (see `contracts/EVENTS.md`)
  carrying the withdrawn amount and the remaining balance, so indexers can
  reconcile on-chain `total_raised` with funds actually received.
- **No strandability**: the withdrawal path is intentionally not gated on the
  contract pause flag or the project's active state, so funds can always be
  recovered by the project wallet (mirrors the permissionless
  `execute_emergency_withdrawal` precedent).

## Off-Chain Oracle Attestation for Project Impact Verification (#459)

Gated behind the `impact_verification` Cargo feature (on by default; excluded from the size-checked `--no-default-features` CI build). Lets admin-authorised verifiers submit independent measurements of a project's actual CO₂ impact, which the contract compares against the project's self-reported (claimed) rate.

### Trust model

- **Verifiers are admin-appointed**, not permissionless. `add_impact_verifier` / `remove_impact_verifier` require `require_admin_for_routine`, so the same trust assumption as every other routine admin action (single admin signature, or 1-of-N under the Phase B multi-sig model) applies here too. A compromised admin key can add an adversarial verifier; this is not a new SPOF beyond what Phase B already accepts for routine operations.
- **Reports are not adversarially aggregated.** `submit_impact_report` does not require multiple verifiers to agree before storage — each report is stored independently. Manipulation resistance comes from the *median* of all distinct verifiers' reports once the threshold is reached, not from any single report being authoritative. A minority of colluding verifiers cannot move the median unless they control a majority of the authorised verifier set.
- **The deviation flag is sticky by design.** Once `ImpactFlagged` is set it stays set until an admin explicitly calls `clear_impact_flag` — a later report that happens to fall back within tolerance does not silently clear it. This forces a human admin decision rather than letting a flag disappear on its own.
- **Duplicate submissions cannot inflate the verifier count.** Reports are keyed by `(project_id, verifier)`; a verifier resubmitting updates their existing record and does not add a second entry to the distinct-verifier list used for both the threshold check and the median.
- **The threshold is admin-configurable** (`set_impact_report_threshold`, falls back to `DEFAULT_IMPACT_REPORT_THRESHOLD = 3` when unset) so operators can tune how many independent verifiers are required before the contract trusts their consensus enough to overwrite `co2_per_xlm` without further admin sign-off.

### Bounds and overflow

`verified_co2_rate` is checked against the same `MAX_CO2_PER_XLM` bound used at project registration and by `update_project_co2_rate`, so an auto-adjustment can never push a project's rate above the platform-wide ceiling. The median itself is additionally clamped to `[1, MAX_CO2_PER_XLM]` before being written, guarding against a `co2_per_xlm = 0` write (which `update_project_co2_rate` treats as invalid) even in a degenerate single-verifier case.

### Event audit trail

| Event topic | Trigger                                                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `impv_add`  | `add_impact_verifier` authorised a new verifier                 |
| `impv_rem`  | `remove_impact_verifier` revoked a verifier                      |
| `impv_thr`  | `set_impact_report_threshold` changed the auto-adjust threshold  |
| `impv_sub`  | `submit_impact_report` recorded or updated a report              |
| `impv_flg`  | A submission deviated ≥50% from the claimed rate                |
| `impv_adj`  | `co2_per_xlm` was auto-adjusted to the new median                |
| `impv_clr`  | `clear_impact_flag` cleared a project's deviation flag           |
## Anonymous donation proof trust model (#432)

The optional `zk` feature adds `donate_anonymous_zk`. To keep the deployed
WASM compact, the contract uses a verifier-attestation model: an off-chain
prover verifies the circuit and signs the ordered public inputs with Ed25519.
Changing the 32-byte verification key requires the configured M-of-N admin
threshold.

The signed statement is:

`project_id_hash || amount_commitment || nullifier`

Each component is 32 bytes. `project_id_hash` is SHA-256 of the Soroban XDR
encoding of the project ID. The first 16 bytes of `amount_commitment` are the
positive, big-endian `i128` amount used for public project/global accounting;
the remaining bytes are circuit-defined blinding material. A successfully
verified nullifier is stored and cannot be reused.

This design hides donor identity from contract storage and donor-specific
statistics, but it is not an in-WASM Groth16 verifier. Soundness depends on the
off-chain circuit, prover, and signing-key custody. Ledger observers may still
identify a transaction submitter unless a relayer is used. Exact public totals
also mean the donation amount is recoverable from the public commitment.

## Multi-Token Donation Support (#421)

### Trust model & Registry security

- **Token registration is admin-gated.** `register_token` and `remove_token` require `require_admin_for_routine` and are paused-gated by `require_not_paused`. Only authorized admins can add or deactivate tokens in the registry.
- **Oracle rate safety.** Oracle conversion uses checked multiplication (`checked_mul`) when computing `xlm_equivalent` from token amounts and oracle price feeds. Oracles returning price <= 0 panic immediately to prevent invalid state.
- **Per-token rate limit isolation.** `donate_token` keys rate limits on `DataKey::DonorRateLimit(donor, project_id, token_address)`. Each asset can use its own `TokenRateLimitMax` and `TokenRateLimitWindow` policy; missing overrides fall back to the global policy. This guarantees that rate limit windows and policies for distinct assets (e.g. XLM vs USDC vs custom tokens) operate independently.
- **Backward compatibility.** Legacy `donate` and `donate_usdc` entrypoints seamlessly delegate to `donate_token_with_privacy`, ensuring existing integrations continue to function without state corruption or breakage.

## Multi-Recipient Platform Fee Distribution (#434)

### Security & Invariant Guarantees

- **Share Sum Validation.** `set_platform_fee_recipients` requires M-of-N critical admin authorization (`require_admin_for_critical`) and validates that the sum of `share_bps` across all recipients equals exactly 10,000 basis points (100.00%). Setting an empty recipient list or shares that do not sum to 10,000 panics immediately.
- **Exact Fee Preservation.** Fee distribution (`split_fee_recipients`) allocates any remainder from integer division to the final recipient, ensuring `sum(recipient_shares) == total_fee_amount` exactly with zero stroop loss.
- **CEI & Transfer Ordering.** Per-recipient fee transfers execute within the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern during donation processing before remaining funds are transferred to the project.
- **Backward Compatibility.** Deployments with legacy single-treasury configuration (`DataKey::PlatformTreasury`) lazily fall back to a single 100% recipient share until `set_platform_fee_recipients` is invoked.
